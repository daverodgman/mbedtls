/** Return an offset into a buffer.

 * This is just the addition of an offset to a pointer, except that this

 * (`p + n` has undefined behavior when `p` is null, even when `n == 0`.
 * A null pointer is a valid buffer pointer when the size is 0, for example
 * as the result of `malloc(0)` on some platforms.)
 *
 * \param p     Pointer to a buffer of at least n bytes.
 *              This may be \p NULL if \p n is zero.
 * \param n     An offset in bytes.
 * \return      Pointer to offset \p n in the buffer \p p.
 *              Note that this is only a valid pointer if the size of the
 *              buffer is at least \p n + 1.
