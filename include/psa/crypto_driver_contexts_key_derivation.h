 *  Warning: This file will be auto-generated in the future.
 *
 * \note This file may not be included directly. Applications must
 * include psa/crypto.h.
 *
 * \note This header and its content are not part of the Mbed TLS API and
 * applications must not depend on it. Its main purpose is to define the
 * multi-part state objects of the PSA drivers included in the cryptographic
 * library. The definitions of these objects are then used by crypto_struct.h
 * to define the implementation-defined types of PSA multi-part state objects.
